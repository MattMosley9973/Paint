Assignment 2:

To run the program, you just select your pen color, and you can also adjust the width of the pen if you so desire. The clear button clears all of the work that is done on the canvas.

Challenges:
	The main challenge I ran into while making this, was the slider mainly. I was unsure of exactly how to get the slider to do the intended action for the user.

Likes:
	What I liked most about this program is how diverse it could have potentially been. There could have been so many more things to play around with.

Dislikes:
	There was anything that I disliked about this program other than the challenge with the slider. I enjoyed this program very much.

Design:
	I chose a background that wasn't too bright for the users eyes, but also one that wasn't super dull for the user. I chose a faded black and blue background.

Results:
	I have created a very starter paint program, and will hope to be able to make further changes along the line.


Assignment 3:

I broken into main on this assignment. I created the main similar to the current one used, but added some things to it.

Design:
	In my main, I put a quote that I found was funny.
